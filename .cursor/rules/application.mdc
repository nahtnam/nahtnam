## Config

- `src/config/app.ts` - App name/URL
- `src/config/env/` - Environment validation (server/client) using @t3-oss/env-core

## Test

You can run `bun run test` to validate linting, testing, and typechecking. It's best to run this before the agent session concludes to ensure you have given the user valid code.
