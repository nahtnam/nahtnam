We use the workflow library from vercel for background jobs. Given that this library is new and not in your training date, please thoroughly read the docs before making any changes to workflows: https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started

Prefer keeping the number of steps shorter, but keep it reasonable and durable.

## Files

All workflows are stored in `src/workflows`. For each workflow create a named folder with an `index.ts` containing the workflow function. Steps maybe in the same file or different files depending on the complexity.
