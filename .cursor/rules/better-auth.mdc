All authentication relies on native better-auth with very little modification. You can find all docs on: https://www.better-auth.com/docs/introduction

Always prefer doing things the better-auth way including more complex asks such as admin capabilities, organization support, or even billing. Prefer using the standard better-auth plugins.

### Files

- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Better Auth server instance (Google OAuth)
- `src/lib/auth-client.ts` - Isomorphic auth client

Note that while better-auth docs specify to use `auth` on the server, we have made `authClient` on isomorphic. ALWAYS use the authClient function in the `src/routes` folders and only `auth` in the `src/server` folder. Since authClient is isomorphic you can simply use it in loaders and with tanstack start.
