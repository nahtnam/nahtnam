When working with any shadcn components you must first pull and read the documentation for that component. You can find the full list of all components documents here: @https://ui.shadcn.com/llms.txt

All files are stored in `src/routes/-shadcn`. You must never edit any files in this folder, not write new components to this folder. This folder is entirely automatically generated with the shadcn CLI and is excluded from linting as well.

Always prefer ShadCN components over writing anything yourself. If you need a a special design system level component, ask the user what they want. There are hundreds of alternative shadcn repositories you can get components from as opposed to writing the code yourself.
