Spark just released a new update: https://sparkmailapp.com/blog/all-new-spark. Unfortunately, their free plan now injects a footer that says "Sent with Spark". While this is fine for most casual email users, it is a bit unprofessional for me so I will need to upgrade to their paid plan. While I fully respect their decision to become paid, and would happy pay for a product I like, I thought I'd shop around for other paid options to find the best one.

- Dark mode
- Web browser login for quick access
- Actively updated

#### Cons
